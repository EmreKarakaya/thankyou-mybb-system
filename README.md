NOTE:
</b>
If you have a previouse version or some similar plugin only deactivate your plugin first at all (Actually using on your forums).
<br />
Then you have to UPLOAD this new files, only at this point. And finally go to your admin CP and activate this new plugin.
<br />
Configure at your own, customize styleshet thx_buttons.css and DNT thanks plugin templates as you wish and have to work.
<br />
For security purpposes don't change any values like CSS o your templates, to do that only have to change on stylesheet and that's all xD.

Enjoy it !!!
